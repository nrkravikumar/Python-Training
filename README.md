## Introduction to Python:
  
   ### Some Keypoints:
  
    -> Number of lines of Code reduce

    -> By default python libraries(h/w -> s/w -> Internet -> s/w -> h/w)[IOT with Python]
    {remote access,Tv,A/c,setupbox}

    -> H/w -> S/w -> User[manual] -> S/w -> H/w(h/w -> s/w)[C libraries]

    -> Interpreter Language:
          Errors -> (line X)
          ---------
          ---------
    -> Compiler Language:
          Errors -> (lines execute)
          -> (All errors display)

## Python Versions:

 - Python 2.XX (number of methods X)<br/>
	    Ex: print "Hello" -> statement
 - Python 3.XX (number of libraries)<br/>
	    Ex: print("Hello") -> function(method)
      
## Installations:
    -> https://python.org
    -> Python.exe
    -> Last checkbox [tick] Add path to environment variables
    -> next
    -> finish
    -> open cmd and type the command as -> python -V
    
## Ways to Execute Python Program:
  ### 1. Editor(Notepad) with python s/w:
    Example: print("Hello Welcome")
        -> Notepad,cmd,python
    Syntax:
        -> python filename.ext (or) filename.py
        -> python sample.py
  ### 2. Advanced Editors(geany,sublime,atom,notepad++,editplus) with python s/w:
    Example: print("Hello")
        -> Editor,python,cmd
    Based on editors preference we can use shortcuts
        -> Geany: -> F8 => Compiler
                  -> F9 => Build
                  -> F5 => Execute
  ### 3. IDLE(Integrated Development Learning Environment)(Package of IDE's):
  	-> In IDLE we can access in two ways that is for checking the statements and other is file store and executing
	-> So similar way in command prompt but it executes only the statements because it doesnt have file option in 
	command prompt.
	-> In IDLE we can executes in both cases and while in file it shows the output in shell.
  ### 4. Anaconda(tools like pandas,numpy,matplotlib,scipy,jupyter):
  	-> Here we are going to execute the python programs in Anaconda in that we are preferring Jupyter notebook tool
	-> Its too lengthy to download anaconda the nprefer to download Jupyter Notebook. To install Jupyter notebook 
	we have to follow some steps they are:
	-> pip install jupyter
	-> After installing the jupyter then we need to search in the search menu so in that we can observe the jupyter 
	notebook if we click on that then the server will starts automatically and notebook will opens in browser.
	-> There we can proceed for the coding in jupyter notebook.

## Jupyter Notebook
	-> Jupyter Notebook:[Python]
	-> Documentation -> [.md markdown language]- github
	-> Coding -> python
	-> .py -> pgms -> 1.py [Advce editor -> .py]
	-> .ipynb -> n number of pgms execute -> Jupyter notbook extension
	-> i = Interactive
	-> py = Python
	-> nb = Notebook
	-> 1 cell = 1.py
   ### Coding and Documentation:
	1.Code mode -> command mode -> Blue
		-> edit mode -> Green
		Python Language

	2.Markdown -> command mode -> Blue
		-> edit mode -> Green
		HTML Tags -> Documentation
  ### Shortcuts in jupyter Notebook:
	- esc + m => To change from code - markdown
	- esc + y => To change from markdown - code
	- esc + a => Insert cell above from present cell
	- esc + b => Insert cell below from present cell
	- esc + dd => To delete present cell
	- shift + enter => Execute
